# ArduinoPCMonitor

Hi, Altho I prefer more native C then using the Arduino IDE, here is a easy project i put together in the arduino IDE to print things to displays.

You may not like it, change the code as you please, add support for other displays, remove those you dont use.

## Requirements

* An arduino, ofcourse. or any microcontroller that works in the arduino IDE and has library support for the following libraries
	* LiquidCrystal_I2C (By Marco Schwartz, The one by Jean i could't get to work)
	* TM16xx   
	* Adafruit GFX
## Configuration

## Hardware
